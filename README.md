This project is a web-based Roman Numeral Converter. Users can input a decimal number, and the application converts it into Roman numerals.

Topics Learned: 
- JavaScript Functions and Control Flow: Practiced creating a function to handle Roman numeral conversion logic, with conditional checks for input validation.
- HTML Form Handling and DOM Manipulation: Gained experience with form handling and using JavaScript to display conversion results dynamically within the webpage.
- Error Handling: Implemented error messages for invalid inputs (non-numeric values or numbers outside the range of 1â€“3999).
